Tugwemo is Africa's premier platform for anonymous video chat and meaningful connections. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a safe, inclusive space for people to meet, share stories, and build lasting relationships through anonymous video chatting.

## 🌍 About Tugwemo

**"Tugwemo"** means "Let's meet" in Kinyarwanda, Rwanda's national language. This name embodies our mission: to create meaningful connections between people from all walks of life, fostering understanding, friendship, and cultural exchange through anonymous video conversations.

### Our Vision
Tugwemo was born from the belief that genuine human connections transcend geographical boundaries and cultural differences. In a world increasingly dominated by digital isolation, we provide a safe, inclusive platform where people can:

- **Share Stories**: Exchange experiences, cultures, and perspectives
- **Build Friendships**: Form lasting relationships through meaningful interactions
- **Learn and Grow**: Discover new cultures, languages, and worldviews

### Cultural Significance
As Africa's first anonymous video chat platform, Tugwemo celebrates the continent's rich cultural heritage while embracing global connectivity. We support multiple languages (Kinyarwanda, English, French, Swahili) and incorporate Africa-specific features that honor our traditions while welcoming the world.

### Safety First
